# 🕹️ Pong Game (Python + Pygame + Trained AI)

A feature-rich Pong game built with **Python** and **Pygame**, featuring:
- Local multiplayer
- Classic AI opponents with difficulty levels
- A trained AI opponent powered by deep reinforcement learning (Stable-Baselines3)
- Menu navigation
- Optional online multiplayer (basic socket connection ready)
- Visual polish including background, fonts, and score display

## 🎮 Features

### ✅ Game Modes
- **Play Local**: 2 players on the same keyboard
- **Play vs AI**: Choose between `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`
- **Play vs Trained AI**: A dynamic AI opponent trained using PPO with Stable-Baselines3
- **Online Multiplayer**: Basic socket setup for 1v1 play over LAN/local IP

### 🧠 Trained AI
- Built using a custom OpenAI Gym environment
- Observes ball and paddle positions and score difference
- Adapts its difficulty during gameplay:
  - Plays easier if it’s winning
  - Plays harder if it's losing
- Model trained using PPO (`trained_model.zip`) via `Stable-Baselines3`
